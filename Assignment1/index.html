		<h1>ANALOG FANTOM</h1>
		
		<h3>Producer, MC, Guitarist, Button Masher</h3>
		
		
		
		<div class="standard-paragraph">Analog Fantom was born out of boredom and desperation to hear new music. MCing in a train of thought style and using synthesizers, drum machines, effects pedals, guitars, and sampling various old records to create otherworldly sounds, Analog Fantom is all about pushing musical boundaries.
		</div>	
		
		<div class="caption">I've been making music for as long as I can remember and seems as natural to me as breathing air. From strumming wildly on my grandfather's Stratocaster as a toddler to figuring out the intricacies of an Akai MPC 2000, music is and always will be a part of me.
